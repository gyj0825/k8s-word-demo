# Kubernetes Wordsmith Demo

Wordsmith is the demo project on k8s.

The demo app runs across three containers:

- [db](db/Dockerfile) - a Postgres database which stores words

- [words](words/Dockerfile) - a Java REST API which serves words read from the database

- [web](web/Dockerfile) - a Go web application which calls the API and builds words into sentences:


## Deploy Using a Kubernetes Manifest

You can deploy the same app to Kubernetes using the [Kubernetes manifest](kube-deployment.yml). That describes the same application in terms of Kubernetes deployments, services and pod specifications.

Apply the manifest using `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f kube-deployment.yml
```

Now browse to http://<Web-External-IP> and you will see the same site.

 Check the services are up, and you should see output like this:

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
words-api    ClusterIP      172.31.0.65      <none>        8080/TCP         4s
words-db     ClusterIP      172.31.0.243     <none>        5432/TCP         4s
words-web    LoadBalancer   172.31.0.58      192.168.0.9   80:30220/TCP     3s
```

Check the pods are running, and you should see one pod each for the database and web components, and five pods for the words API - which is specified as the replica count in the compose file:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
words-api-9787944d6-f544j    1/1     Running   0          6s
words-api-9787944d6-fdczp    1/1     Running   0          6s
words-api-9787944d6-q4rdc    1/1     Running   0          6s
words-api-9787944d6-qqzb5    1/1     Running   0          6s
words-api-9787944d6-vbcn4    1/1     Running   0          6s
words-db-cc96d879d-fmzqk     1/1     Running   0          6s
words-web-69dbfc57cb-rlprp   1/1     Running   0          6s
```

Then browse to http://<Web-External-IP> to see the site. Each time you refresh the page, you'll see a different sentence generated by the API calls.
